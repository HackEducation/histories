<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2018/04/05/history-of-education-technology">I asked over on Hack Education</a> for folks to help me think of books about the history of education. I got a lot of suggestions, although almost none of them were works of history. I did not realize it was such a confusing genre. (It's not like I asked something weird like "books on the anthropology of education technology." But hey.)</p> 

<p>I have created a page <a href="http://history.hackeducation.com/books.html">here</a> that lists some of the titles. It does not include works of sociology or guides on instructional design. It also does not include "books <em>from</em> history," that is books written by notable historical figures in the field.</p>
